# Expense Splitter Prompt for Claude Code

Build a React app using Vite that splits expenses when friends share food.

## The Problem
When Filipinos eat out, we share food. Example:
- Juan orders Chicken BBQ for ₱180
- Pedro orders Pork BBQ for ₱200  
- Maria didn't order but eats from both (nakikain)

How much should each person pay?

## What to Build
A simple app where you can:
1. Add people's names
2. Add food orders (item, price, who ordered)
3. Mark which items are shared and who's eating them
4. See how much each person should pay

## Keep It Simple
- Use Vite + React (JavaScript)
- Basic styling is fine
- Focus on making it work, not making it pretty

That's it. Build this expense splitter that handles food sharing.
